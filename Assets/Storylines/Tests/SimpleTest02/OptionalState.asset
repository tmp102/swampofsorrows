  title: 'Unfulfilled Desires '
  description: "During one of the masses, you found yourself entranced by the beauty
    one of the sisters, Agatha, after which you spent a few nights together right
    under the abbess' nose. As this is probably the last chance to see her, you can't
    help but attempt one last encounter of forbidden love.\r\n\r\nYou gather all the
    inconspicuousness you can and take a stroll through the empty cloister towards
    the latrine, inside and through the window into the gardens that connect the men's
    and women's convents. But to your dismay, the window is closed shut and your sexual
    fervour will have to remain unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nYou step out, disappointed."
