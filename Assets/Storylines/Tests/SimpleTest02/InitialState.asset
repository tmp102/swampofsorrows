  title: A New Day
  description: "Morning sun warms your face as you step into the cloister. One cleric
    after another walk by you as they rush to the first daily service. It has been
    almost a month since the monks took you in as you fled certain death from the
    unknown assassins that murdered your family. The Considian Order might be by most
    folks considered just a bunch of religious zealots, but their hospitality is certainly
    unmatched, at least in the region.\r\n\nHowever, despite the comfort of a warm
    bed and fresh food, you know that you cannot spend the entirety of the rest of
    your life hiding in a monastery and that the monks would not let you stay here
    forever either. Unless you would take the vows, that is."
