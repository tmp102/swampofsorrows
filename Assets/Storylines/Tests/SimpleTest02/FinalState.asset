  title: The Journey Continues
  description: "The abbot does not question your judgement nor does he agree. He calmly
    hears out your case and without a word grabs a blank parchment, quill and a large
    bottle of ink. As he hastily scrawls a letter, likely for you to deliver to someone,
    he words its intentions to you:\r\n\r\n\"Go see friar Virgilio over in Demessi.
    It's a large town north from here, you might have heard of it. Give him this and
    he will give you shelter and possibly aid in your search for justice. If you leave
    now, you will arrive by dusk,\" he pushes the letter into your palm as his hand
    motions to you to leave.\r\n\r\nSeeing there's no point in dawdling around, you
    pack your belongings and set out into the world once again."
