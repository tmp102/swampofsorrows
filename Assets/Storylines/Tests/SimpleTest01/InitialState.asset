  m_Title: A Blood-thirsty Goblin
  m_Description: You land your feet onto the wet cave floor and your eyes take a while
    to adjust from the bright daylight to the torch-lit underground. As you take a
    look around, you immediately spot a goblin leaning against a wall, deep in thought.
    You look into his gaze and see his emotions shifting as he notices you, from sheer
    surprise and confusion to determination and anger. He lets out a shriek that could
    rival that of a harpy, lifts his axe and begins to run towards you with another
    scream, this time a deeper one, longer, more controlled.
