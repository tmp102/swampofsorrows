1. A Blood-thirsty Goblin
You land your feet onto the wet cave floor and your eyes take a while to adjust from the bright daylight to the torch-lit underground. As you take a look around, you immediately spot a goblin leaning against a wall, deep in thought. You look into his gaze and see his emotions shifting as he notices you, from sheer surprise and confusion to determination and anger. He lets out a shriek that could rival that of a harpy, lifts his axe and begins to run towards you with another scream, this time a deeper one, longer, more controlled.

2. Victory
Just as you raise your sword, the goblin, salivating in anticipation, runs himself into you, slicing the tip of your blade into and out of his guts. With a violent gurgle and blood spraying through his clenched teeth, he dies mere moments after.
